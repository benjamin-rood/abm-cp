/*
Timeframe holds the model's representation of the time metrics.
Turn – The cycle length for all agents ∈ 𝐄 to perform 1 (and only 1) Action.
Phase – Division of a Turn, between agent sets, environmental effects/factors,
				and updates to populations and model conditions (via external).
				One Phase is complete when all members of a set have performed an Action
				or all requirements for the model's continuation have been fulfilled.
Action – An individual 'step' in the model. All Actions have a cost:
				the period (number of turns) before that specific Action can be
				performed again. For most actions this is zero.
				Some Actions could also *stop* any other behaviour by that agent
				for a period.

Environment specifies the boundary / dimensions of the working model. They
